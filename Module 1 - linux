Basic Commands in Linux

1) Commands are actually files containing programs, often written in C. How will you find out in which directory does  the file corresponding to the man command resides?

Command => where is man
           which man

Explanation => the following command to find the location of the man executable file

2) How will you find out what is the use of the ps command.

Command => man ps

Explanation => To display the man page for the ps command

                    or

Command => whatis ps

Explanation => This command shows a single line description about the command

General Purpose Utilities in Linux

1)Display the calender for the month of March 2012 

Command => cal 03 2012
           cal

Explanation => To display the calendar for the month of March 2012 in Linux
               To display the calendar for the current month and year

2)List all the files and directories of the directory /usr/lib on the terminal. Now put the same information in a file named results. 
  Display the contents of the file results now.

Command => ls -l /usr/lib
           ls -l /usr/lib > results
           cat results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File Systems 

1)Make a directory structure like this in your home directory

COmmand => mkdir demodir
           cd demodir
           mkdir inside_demo also_inside_demo
           cd also_inside_demo
           mkdir abc abc_123

Explanation => mkdir -> to create a directory
               cd -> change directory

2) Remove the also_inside_demo directory

Command => rm -r also_inside_demo
           rmdir also_inside_demo

Explanation => -r -> to recursively remove all in the directory
               rmdir -> remove directory if it is empty

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File Attributes

1. Create a file abc.txt and change the ownership of this file to some other user on your machine,
   and also change the group to family.

Command => touch abc.txt
           sudo useradd newuser
           sudo groupadd family
           chown newuser:family abc.txt
           ls -l abc.txt
Explanation => chown -> change ownership of files
               useradd -> Adds a new user
               groupadd -> Adds a new group

2. Create a file exercise.txt and make it executable.

Command => touch exercise.txt
           chmod +x exercise.txt

Explanation => Make the file executable using the chmod command

3. Create a file test.txt on your desktop and identify its inode number, also create a softlink
   for test.txt in your home.

Command => touch test.txt
           ls -li
           ln -s /home/user/Desktop/test.txt /home

Redirection of Pipes

1. Create a file name error_log in your current directory. Suppose you do not have any file named aa11 in your current directory. 
   How  can you redirect the error message to the file error_log when we apply the command "wc -l aa11" ?  
   How can you ensure that all the error log are appended to the error_log file?

Command => touch error_log
           wc -l aa11 2> error_log
           wc -l aa11 2>> error_log

Explanation => > -> redirection 
               >> -> redirection with appending
               file descriptor 2 is used for standard error (stderr).

2. Create  files named test1, test2, testa, testb
   How can you count the number of files starting with test and then having only one digit in their name using only a single line command ?

Command => touch test1 test2 testa testb
           ls | grep -c "^test[0-9]$"

Explanation => The ls command lists all of the files in the current directory.
               The grep command filters the output of the ls command to only include files that start with test and then have only one digit in their name.
               The wc -l command counts the number of lines in the output of the grep command.

Working with processes

1. Open a terminal. Now spawn three shell processes one after another i.e. first spawn one shell, then from the spawned shell, spawn one new shell and so on. Now, 
   how can you see the PID of the current shell ? How can you see the PID of the shell which is the grandparent of the current shell?

Command => /bin/bash -i
            /bin/bash -i
            /bin/bash -i
            ps all
            pstree

Explanation => ps all would show all the running process and their ids
               pstree shows the hierarchy of processes

2. How can you see all the processes (both system & user processes) in your computer?
   The output can be quite large.  How can you view the output as multipage output ? 
   How can you store the output in a file named process_info?

Command => ps -e 
           ps -e | more
           ps -e > process_info
